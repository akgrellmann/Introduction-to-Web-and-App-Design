    <p>WRONG.</p>
    <p> Just as you're about to step into the shower, you plant your feet firmly on the floor and declare: NO SHOWER!</p>
    <p>Of course there is no genie. This is obviously a trick to make you take a shower. Nice try, soap.</p>
    <p> With all your might, you hurl the soap across the room, out the window.</p>
    <p> You don't need some tiny voice trying to trick you into washing yourself. Never ever.</p>
