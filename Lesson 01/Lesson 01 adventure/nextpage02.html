    <p>Nope. Nothing. Just the bar of soap.</p>
    <p>You take one step a little closer and ask: "Who is calling for help?"</p>
    <p>The little voice coming from the bar of soap screams: "Me! It's me! Don't leave me here like this, lying on the ground! Please!"</p>
    <p> What do you do?</p>

    <a href="nextpage02-A.html">Option A: You think: "Soap that talks? Nope. Absolutelly not!", leave the soap on the ground and go home.</a><br>
    <a href="nextpage02-B.html">Option B: You pick up a stick and poke the soap to see if it reacts.</a>
