    <p>You are a little kid who is terrified of water and proudly introduce yourself as a kid who never took a bath.</p> 
	<p>As you walk down the street, you suddenly hear a tiny voice screaming for help.</p>
	<p>It seems to be coming from… a purple bar of soap on the ground!</p>
	<p>What do you do?</p>

    <a href="nextpage01.html">Option 1: Ignore and walk away. Soap isn't supposed to talk. </a><br>
    <a href="nextpage02.html">Option 2: You look around, just in case the voice is coming from something else.</a>
