    <p>You ask the soap: "Where do you want me to put you? I don't like soap... not even the kind that can talk!"</p>
    <p>The voice responds: "I'm not a talking soap! I'm a genie who is trapped inside this soap! If you release me, I can grant you all your wishes! I can make you rich! Famous! You just need to use the soap until I'm free!"</p>

    <p>To use the soap... that means taking a shower. Or worse. Multiple showers.</p>
    <p>Your soul leaves your body for a second.</p>
    <p> What do you do?</p>

    <a href="nextpage02-B-B-A1.html">Option A: Not amount of money or fame is worth enduring a shower. You drop the soap on the ground and run away. </a><br>
    <a href="nextpage02-B-B-B1.html">Option B: You start thinking about all the things you could wish for: toys, candy, video games... You decide to take the soap with you.</a>
