        // var is an older way of creating variables in JavaScript (it needs to be written in lowercase)
        var myVariable; //this creates a variable but doesn't assign anything into it

        var myAssignedVariable = "sugar"; //here we both create and assign a variable

        //let is how most people create variables nowadays
        let worldPeace = "soon";
        worldPeace = "not likely" //you can re-assign a variable created with let

        const pi = 3.14159 //when you use const to create a variable, you can't reassign it later (is used for something that not gonna change)

        // pi = 2.5; in this case, it will show an error message in the console on your browser

        const player = {
            name: "Antti",
            score: 0
        }
        
        //player = "cat"; //still can't reassign a const

        player.score = 1; //the thing assigned to a const can change, just you can't assign something else to the const

        //TYPES

        let myString = "abcdefg"; //a string type of variable

        //you can't or shouldn't really do math with strings, but JS kind of weird when it comes to that...

        let memeString = "11";

        console.log(memeString +1); //console.log 111
        console.log(memeString - 1); //console.log 10 so here the math is weirdly working

        //Explanation:
        // the operator + is also used for the concatenation of string like this:

        let firstPart = "Hello";
        let secondPart = " World";

        console.log(firstPart + secondPart); //logs HelloWord
        console.log(firstPart - secondPart); //logs NaN because the operator - is not used that way, only used a math operator, 
        // because usually doesn't make sense, like how can I substract something that is not a number?
        // so because + and - are used a bit differently in JS, when you subtract, a number looking string gets coerced into a actual number
